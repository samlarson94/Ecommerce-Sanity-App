## Description
- Built with React.js and Next.js, this responsive web store can easily be altered to fit a future client's needs.
- Utilizes Sanity.io for simple database configuration and content management.  I saw this as a solution to save time and energy when setting up and maintaining the backend server, database, and schemas.
- Utilizes Stripe for payments.  I saw this as an important technology to gain experience with and the most secure solution for checkout.
- CSS Development and Styling still under development. I would love to make this into a modern version of "Speaker City", Vince Vaughn's electronic store in the comedy "Old School". 

## Helpful Sanity Commands
- "sanity docs" = explore sanity studio in browser (works anywhere within project)
- "sanity manage" = opens up sanity manager in browser (works anywhere within project)
- "sanity start" = opens up sanity dataset studio in the browser under localhost:3333.  This is where you can create, update, and delete products, sales, etc. (works only when )

## Confetti Resource
