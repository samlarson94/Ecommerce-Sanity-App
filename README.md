## Ecommerce App

## Description
- Utilizes Sanity.io for database configuration and content management.  I saw this as a solution to save time and energy when setting up and maintaining the backend server, database, and schemas.

## Helpful Sanity Commands
- "sanity docs" = explore sanity studio in browser (works anywhere within project)
- "sanity manage" = opens up sanity manager in browser (works anywhere within project)
- "sanity start" = opens up sanity dataset studio in the browser under localhost:3333.  This is where you can create, update, and delete products, sales, etc. (works only when )

## Confetti Resource
- Easy confetti animation available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti
